   Description = "This project builds a command line tool written in Pascal with the Free Pascal Compiler. It has been tested with Xcode 2.1 and 2.3, but should work with later and possibly also with earlier versions. No particular version of FPC is required. It can be used to create universal binaries when running on an Intel Mac with Xcode 2.3 or later and both the PowerPC and Intel versions of FPC installed.";
